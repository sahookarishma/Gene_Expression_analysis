## üìå Dataset Information

- **GEO Accession ID**: [GSE113513](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE113513)  
- **Platform**: GPL15207	[PrimeView] Affymetrix Human Gene Expression Array 
- **Samples**: fourteen pairs of CRC primary lesions and non-cancerous surrounding tissue. 
- **Organism**: Homo sapiens  
- **Study Description**: 	Samples from fourteen colorectal cancer patients who had undergone surgical resection of colorectal cancer were collected. No patients had received radio- or chemotherapy prior to surgery. To identify molecular signatures of CRC, we examined the DEGs in fourteen pairs of CRC primary lesions and non-cancerous surrounding tissue.
